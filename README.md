# Installation

`aurman -S libiio` gets source from https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libiio it also comes with python bindings https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libiio/tree/master/bindings/python

```[martin@gpd learn_py_iio]$ iio_info -n 192.168.2.1 | grep device
IIO context has 5 devices:
        iio:device3: cf-ad9361-dds-core-lpc (buffer capable)
        iio:device1: ad9361-phy
                18 device-specific attributes found:
                                attr  0: dcxo_tune_coarse ERROR: No such device (-19)
                                attr  6: dcxo_tune_fine ERROR: No such device (-19)
        iio:device4: cf-ad9361-lpc (buffer capable)
                                attr  3: samples_pps ERROR: No such device (-19)
                                attr  3: samples_pps ERROR: No such device (-19)
        iio:device2: xadc
                1 device-specific attributes found:
        iio:device0: adm1177
```
Aurman and cmake only install iio for python 3. ccmake only shows PYTHON_BINDINGS. I just install it manually after the build:
```
cd bindings/python/
[martin@gpd python]$ ls
CMakeFiles  Makefile  build  cmake_install.cmake  setup.py
[martin@gpd python]$ sudo python2 setup.py install
```


`git clone https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libad9361-iio`


`https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/plutosdr-fw` seems to contain the firmware sources, I haven't tried building it, yet
